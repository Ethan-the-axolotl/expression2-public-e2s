# expression2-public-e2s
A collection of my public libraries/expression2 files.
Feel free to leave me suggestions for e2s and libraries, and to commit when you feel something is needed.

## How to INSTALL Libraries:
__Method 1 - Copy into GMOD:__
Unfortunately, this method is slower since you can't directly copy a text file from github.
1. Open the github public e2 text, of course.
2. Copy and paste ALL of it into a text file.
3. Save that file and drag it into your gmod/garrysmod/data/expression2 folder
  "gmod" usually being [YOURSTEAMFOLDER]/steamapps/common/GarrysMod
4. Enjoy!

__Method 2: - Copy into Expression 2:__
This method is a little faster, but with e2s longer than a hundred lines, you will have to copy-paste multiple
times, as the e2 editor does not support pasting a ton of chars.
1. Open the github public e2 text, of course.
2. Copy and paste it into the expression 2 tool.
3. Make sure everything is the same to github and that everything pasted successfully.
4. Enjoy!

###Please, let me know if you encounter any bugs with my e2s.
