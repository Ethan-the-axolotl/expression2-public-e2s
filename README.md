A collection of my public libraries/expression2 files.
Feel free to leave me suggestions for e2s and libraries, and to commit when you feel something is needed.

Also, to note before looking into my libraries: (LIBRARIES NOT CHIPS)
Libraries in e2 are very inefficient. They have a flat 20 ops penalty for calling any user function once and they don't have syntax highlighting. I would not recommend getting used to using libraries such as the math or stringext ones I or anyone else have made as they really only provide small functionality you can do yourself without a userfunction. But if you don't care about OPS / efficiency, then go for it.

## How to INSTALL Expression2s/Libraries:
__Method 1 - Copy into GMOD:__
  Unfortunately, this method is slower since you can't directly copy a text file from github.
  1. Open the github public e2 text, of course.
  2. Copy and paste ALL of it into a text file.
  3. Save that file and drag it into your gmod/garrysmod/data/expression2 folder
    "gmod" usually being [YOURSTEAMFOLDER]/steamapps/common/GarrysMod

__Method 2: - Copy into Expression 2:__
  This method is a little faster, but with e2s longer than a hundred lines, you will have to copy-paste multiple
  times, as the e2 editor does not support pasting a ton of chars.
  1. Open the github public e2 text, of course.
  2. Copy and paste it into the expression 2 tool.
  3. Make sure everything is the same to github and that everything pasted successfully.

__Both Methods:__
Read for any additional instructions in the form of e2 comments.
## How to USE Expression2s/Libraries:
  #### Libraries:
  1. Use #include "e2name" in your code with e2name being the name of the e2 you saved the library in.
  2. Enjoy, all the functions will appear red as if the e2 doesn't recognize them but it'll work.
  #### E2s:
  1. Follow the instructions in the written e2 if there are any.
  2. Enjoy, all the functions will appear red as if the e2 doesn't recognize them but it'll work.
  2a. If there aren't, just read the code to see what it does or make an issue to this github.
### Please, let me know if you encounter any bugs with my e2s.
