# TinyTokenizer

## How to use

```golo
#include "filepathtotinytokenizer"
e2docgenerate("# TinyTokenizer",getCode()) # -- > Will be saved to e2docs/hashofe2chip.txt
```

## No more auto-generating docs for this until I make it string /comment proof cause it does not like reading itself

Here's what you'd get though. (I love returning func)
Yes, this was made with the chip
This gives a string of documentation that is sorted by name of function type returned and hopefully will have some extra stuff in other versions.
Note that this can still catch comments and strings.
